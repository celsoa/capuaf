README_EXAMPLE

Test examples for CAP.
The default example should always be run, prior to committing any changes to the code.

====================================================================================
EXTRA START-UP INSTRUCTIONS FOR UAF CLUSTER

0. By default, do not run cap on a cluster (skip this step).
The following instructions apply to the UAF cluster.

0a. check modules:

> module list

pacman12 % module list
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) git/1.8.2.3               3) openmpi-gnu-4.7.3/1.4.3   5) netcdf/4.3.0.gnu-4.7.3
  2) gcc/4.7.3                 4) PrgEnv-gnu/4.7.3

0b. set up your directories

> cd $CENTER
> mkdir -p CAP
> cd CAP

0c. check out a local copy of CAP

git clone https://USERNAME@github.com/uafseismo/cap.git src

0d. assign $CAPHOME in your .bashrc, e.g., 

export CAPHOME=$CENTER/CAP/src

0e. load environmental variables with this command (add it to your .bashrc file if you want):

> source /import/unsupported/erthquak/bashrc_seismo_util

note that $CAPHOME must be assigned prior to sourcing bashrc_seismo_util

0f. uncomment $green in cap.pl to point to FK_synthetics on UAF cluster

====================================================================================
START-UP INSTRUCTIONS FOR UAF LINUX NETWORK

1. check paths (see .bashrc)

> echo "CAPHOME =" $CAPHOME ;  echo "CAPRUN =" $CAPRUN ; echo "NRHOME_C =" $NRHOME_C ; echo "GMTHOME =" $GMTHOME

Make sure that none of these is empty.

2015-12-01 test:
echo "GMTHOME =" $GMTHOME
CAPHOME = /home/carltape/REPOSITORIES/cap
CAPRUN = /home/carltape/PROJECTS/CAP
NRHOME_C = /usr/local/seismo/grp-utils/nr/NR_C302/legacy/nr2/C_211_mod
GMTHOME = /usr/local/gmt

note: by default at UAF these are set in /home/admin/share/global_bashrc
      so you should not have to set these yourself

export GEOTOOLS=$HOME/GEOTOOLS
export SUTIL=/usr/local/seismo
export NRHOME_C=$SUTIL/grp-utils/nr/NR_C302/legacy/nr2/C_211_mod
export NRHOME_F90=$SUTIL/grp-utils/nr/recipes_f-90
export CAPHOME=$GEOTOOLS/tomo_util/cap
export PATH=$CAPHOME:$PATH
export CAPRUN=$HOME/PROJECTS/CAP
export PATH=$PATH:$SUTIL/bin:$HOME/bin:.

If you make any changes to your .bashrc variables, be sure to source the file:

> source ~/.bashrc

2. set up directories within $CAPRUN

> echo $CAPRUN
> mkdir -p $CAPRUN
> cd $CAPRUN
> mkdir -p models/cus inv/cus

3. compile cap.c

> cd $CAPHOME
> make all >& make.log

note: "make clean" before compilation if you have a previously compiled cap

4. check path to utilities

> cd $CAPRUN
> which fk pssac2 cap cap.pl cap_plt.pl depth.pl depth_test

Make sure that none of these is missing.

2015-12-01 test:
/usr/local/seismo/bin/fk
/usr/local/seismo/bin/pssac2
~/REPOSITORIES/cap/cap
~/REPOSITORIES/cap/cap.pl
~/REPOSITORIES/cap/cap_plt.pl
~/REPOSITORIES/cap/depth.pl
~/REPOSITORIES/cap/depth_test

====================================================================================
DEFAULT EXAMPLE 1: Illinois event, double couple (DC)

0. modify cap.pl to indicate that you want to compute your own Green's functions

Uncomment the following line in cap.pl

$green = "$caprun/models";                # user testing

1. run the frequency-wavenumber code fk

> cd $CAPRUN/models/cus
> cp $SUTIL/grp-utils/fk3.0/cus .
> fk.pl -Mcus/15 -N512/0.4/2 140 145 205 230 260 275 295 410

note: this uses the "cus" 1D model for "central U.S."
note: You do not need to run fk if you have a pre-computed library of Green's functions.

2. run fk again to generate isotropic components

> fk.pl -Mcus/15 -N512/0.4/2 -S0 140 145 205 230 260 275 295 410

 This will create 3 additional green functions for each distance of the form dist.grn.(a-c),
 e.g., 140.grn.a, 140.grn.b, 140.grn.c.

3. prepare data directory

> cd $CAPRUN/inv/cus
> rsync -av $CAPHOME/EXAMPLES/20080418093700 .

Check that you have new weight.dat file with 12 columns
> more 20080418093700/weight.dat
%----------------------------------------------------------
Column 1: Station Name
Column 2: Epicentral Distance (Use slash (/) and add first motion polarity info (if available)) - defualt 0 (use from SAC header)
Column 3: PV_weight (weight for vertical component of body wave)
Column 4: PR_weight (weight for radial component of body wave)
Column 5: SurfV_weight (weight for vertical component of surface wave)
Column 6: SurfR_weight (weight for radial component of surface wave)
Column 7: SurfT_weight (weight for transverse component of surface wave)
Column 8: Body wave arrival time (first-arrival time) - default 0 
Column 9: Length of body wave window - default 0 (use same as all other stations (based on input command -T flag))
Column 10: Surface wave arrival time - default 0 
Column 11: Length of surface wave window - default 0 (use same as all other stations (based on input command -T flag))
Column 12: Initial time-shift - default 0

Note:
Zero weight means not to use that particular component.
Negative weight is for teleseismic stations (only P and SH are used).
%----------------------------------------------------------

4. run cap

> cap.pl -H0.2 -P0.6 -S2/5/0 -T35/70 -F -D1/1/0.5 -C0.05/0.3/0.02/0.1 -W1 -X10 -Mcus_15/5.0 -E0 -K0 -Y2 20080418093700

> gv 20080418093700/cus_015.ps &

You should see a reasonable output for a moment tensor inversion.

5. check the output files

> gv $CAPHOME/EXAMPLES/20080418093700_check/cus_015.ps &
> diff 20080418093700/cus_015.out $CAPHOME/EXAMPLES/20080418093700_check/cus_015.out

(The output from the last command should be blank.)

6. From here on out in README_EXAMPLE, we assume that the Green's functions are pre-computed.

Make this change in cap.pl:

$green = "/store/wf/FK_synthetics";        # standard models at UAF
#$green = "$caprun/models";                # user testing

7. perform the depth test

Run cap for different depths by setting the range and increment for which you want to run depth test using -A flag (-Adep_min/dep_max/dep_inc).
One output (.out) file should be generated for each depth.

> cd $CAPRUN/inv/cus
> cap.pl -H0.2 -P1 -S2/5/0 -T35/70 -F -D1/1/0.5 -C0.05/0.3/0.02/0.1 -W1 -X10 -Mcus_15/5.0 -E0 -K0 -Y2 -A5/30/5 20080418093700

Run depth_test (script for calling depth.pl)
> depth_test 20080418093700 cus 
> gv dep_20080418093700.ps &

5. check the depth test

> diff junk1.out $CAPHOME/EXAMPLES/20080418093700_check/junk1_dc.out
> diff junk2.out $CAPHOME/EXAMPLES/20080418093700_check/junk2_dc.out
> gv $CAPHOME/EXAMPLES/20080418093700_check/depth_dc.ps &

TIPS

1. If running in debug mode, remember to remove all the log files otherwise they will be appended (not overwritten!).
2. When running in random seach mode and it doesn't create as many sample points as specified, 
   then retry by giving reduced orientation increment (example: if -I5/0 doesn't work, try -I2/0).
