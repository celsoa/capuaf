Moment tensor catalogs

columns in CAP_database:

1. event ID (origin time) [EVID]

2. version of moment tensor solution
   NOTE: For any published moment tensor, the published version should have index 1. Any future modifications would have higher version numbers, as well as different authors.

3. publication index (see .bib files for tags)
   A. SilwalTape2016
   B. Silwal2015catalog_SAK
   C. Tape2015
   D. Silwal2015catalog_MFFZ

   Use XXX if there is no publication.

4. Original author of the moment tensor solution.
  
5. Reviewed author of the moment tensor solution.
   In many cases, the reviewed author will update the inversion parameters and obtain a different moment tensor solution.

6. Home directory that output directory resides in [COLUMNSIX]
   (In most cases, this will be the same person as the reviewed author.)
 
7. tag for 1D model used
