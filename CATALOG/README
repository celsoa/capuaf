Moment tensor catalogs

Motivation:
1. reproducibility (for ourselves and for others outside of UAF)
2. attribution (so people get credit for their work)
3. accuracy (so we can access the latest and greatest catalogs)

====================================

columns in CAP_database:

1. event ID (origin time) [EVID]

2. version of moment tensor solution
   NOTE: For any published moment tensor, the published version should have index 1. Any future modifications would have higher version numbers, as well as different authors.

3. publication index (see .bib files for tags)
   A. SilwalTape2016
   B. Silwal2015catalog_SAK
   C. Tape2015
   D. Silwal2015catalog_MFFZ

   Use XXX if there is no publication.

4. Original author of the moment tensor solution.
  
5. Reviewed author of the moment tensor solution.
   In many cases, the reviewed author will update the inversion parameters and obtain a different moment tensor solution.

6. Home directory that output directory resides in [COLUMNSIX]
   (In most cases, this will be the same person as the reviewed author.)
 
7. tag for 1D model used

==========

The CAP moment tensor output directories should be found at the path

/home/[COLUMNSIX]/CAPRUN/

For example, for this entry 

20170501123153000 V2 SilwalTape2016 Vipul_Silwal Vipul_Silwal vipul scak 

the output resides here

/home/vipul/CAPRUN/20170501123153000/V2/

This might represent an event that was published in SilwalTape2016 as V1 but has since been updated,
either with a different set of data, different CAP version, different inversion parameters, etc.

IN MOST CASES EACH PERSON WILL PROBABLY SET SYMBOLIC LINKS FROM HIS WORKING DIRECTORY TO CAPRUN.
This way, people can work on projects in various places, but we can always find the folders in CAPRUN.

==========

TO DO (and to think about)

+ need gitversion.txt file for cap.pl and for run_getwaveform.py
  This way we can always determine which version of CAP and run_getwaveform.py were used.
+ There needs to be a way to identify the preferred depth in cases where a depth test is done.
  How about a file like preferred_depth.txt that simply says something like 17 (for 17 km depth)?
