Moment tensor catalogs

Motivation:
1. reproducibility (for ourselves and for others outside of UAF)
2. attribution (so people get credit for their work)
3. accuracy (so we can access the latest and greatest catalogs)

====================================

columns in CAP_database:

1. event ID (origin time) [EVID]

2. version of moment tensor solution
   NOTE: For any published moment tensor, the published version should have index 1. Any future modifications would have higher version numbers, as well as different authors.
   The version could change with:
       different CAP version
       different waveforms extracted or processed
       different weights in input file
       different input command (including different 1D model)

3. publication index (see .bib files for tags)
   A. SilwalTape2016
   B. Silwal2015catalog_SAK
   C. Tape2015
   D. Silwal2015catalog_MFFZ

   Use XXX if there is no publication.

4. Original author of the moment tensor solution.
  
5. Reviewed author of the moment tensor solution.
   In many cases, the reviewed author will update the inversion parameters and obtain a different moment tensor solution.

6. Home directory that output directory resides in [COLUMNSIX]
   (In most cases, this will be the same person as the reviewed author.)
 
7. tag for 1D model used

==========

The CAP moment tensor output directories should be found at the path

/home/[COLUMNSIX]/CAP_DATABASE/

For example, for this entry 

20170501123153000 V1 SilwalTape2016 Vipul_Silwal Vipul_Silwal vipul scak 

the output resides here

/home/vipul/CAP_DATABASE/20170501123153000/

IN MOST CASES EACH PERSON WILL PROBABLY SET SYMBOLIC LINKS FROM HIS WORKING DIRECTORY TO CAP_DATABASE.
This way, people can work on projects in various places, but we can always find the folders in CAP_DATABASE.

Note that links are not the safest route, since if you delete your working directory, we lose the event output.
Ideally the original, saved versions of output files are in CAP_DATABASE (rsync -av).

==========

TO DO (and to think about)

+ There needs to be a way to identify the preferred depth in cases where a depth test is done.
  How about a file like preferred_depth.txt that simply says something like 17 (for 17 km depth)?

+ VERSIONING. Some scripting is needed to establish how to handle multiple versions of the same event.

For example, for this entry 

20170501123153000 V2 SilwalTape2016 Vipul_Silwal Vipul_Silwal vipul scak 

the output could reside here

/home/vipul/CAP_DATABASE/20170501123153000/V2/

This might represent an event that was published in SilwalTape2016 as V1 but has since been updated,
either with a different set of data, different CAP version, different inversion parameters, etc.

==========

HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPTS
1. Create a sub directory 'process' inside CAP_DATABASE
> mkdir ~/CAP_DATABASE/process

2. copy scripts:
> cp create_version ~/CAP_DATABASE/process/
> cp echo_catalog_txt ~/CAP_DATABASE/process/

3. create links inside the 'process' subdirectory:
This will depend on where you are running CAP
> cd ~/CAP_DATABASE/process/
> ln -s /home/vipul/CAP/inv/scak/MOOS/2* .

4. move all the links in the version directory
- All eid links will be changed to directories and the links will be moved inside them with 
> create_version

5. Output text for the ~/REPOSITORIES/cap/CATALOG/CAP_database.txt
> echo_catalog_txt

Note: You will have to make minor edits to create_version and echo_catalog_txt scripts as per your needs
