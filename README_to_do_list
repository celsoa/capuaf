To-do list for CAP

When the item is fixed, just delete it from here.
(Your entry in the svn log will mark the change.)

+ add lon lat depth to cap.out files, so that we have all necessary information for reading them in later (for map plots, for example)

+ read_cap_out.m

+ CAP should be able to run fine with vertical components only, but at the moment you have to copy the files, then set the horizontal component weights to zero
