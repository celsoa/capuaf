"cut-and-paste" seismic moment tensor inversion code
a private github repository within the organization uafseismo
contact: Carl Tape (ctape@alaska.edu)

This repository started as cap2.0, a software package by Lupei Zhu, who emailed it to Carl Tape on 12/15/2012. This repository shows the developments made by Vipul Silwal and Celso Alvizuri since the first commit on 12/28/2012. The official version of CAP is available for download from the website of Lupei Zhu (http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/LZhu/home.html -- last accessed 12/3/2015).

Example check-out command from UAF linux network:
git clone https://GITHUBUSERNAME@github.com/uafseismo/capuaf.git capuaf
You need to have (1) a github account and (2) permission to read the repository.
This checkout takes awhile, since you get the full history of the repository.
If you just want the latest version, then try this:
git clone --depth=1 https://GITHUBUSERNAME@github.com/uafseismo/capuaf.git capuaf

1. Content of the Package

The CAP package contains following main codes:

  cap.c		Cut-and-Paste (CAP) full moment-tensor inversion code.

  cap.pl	A Perl script to simplify the use of cap and to plot waveform fits.

  depth.pl	A perl script to read in the outputs of cap for different
		source depths and estimate the best source depth.


2. Installation

To compile the codes see Makefile. It requires that the Numerical Recipes
Package and SAC have been installed. Set environment variables NR_HOME and
SAC_HOME to point to where they are installed accordingly.


3. Usage

For usage and examples, run cap.pl without argument.

5. Revision History

   1995-2008		LZ	Numerious modifications.
   Mar. 11, 2010 	LZ	Correct a bug when computing Mw using interpolation.
                                Change to no interpolation of FM untill the correct
				Mw is found to aoid unstable interpolation in some cases.
   Mar. 12, 2010	LZ	Add isotropic moment tensor in the inversion.
   June 10, 2010	LZ	Correct a bug introduced in Jan. 2008 which deleted
				distance compensation and Pnl weighting of the
				Greens functions.
   Nov.  5, 2012	LZ	Add CLVD moment tensor.
